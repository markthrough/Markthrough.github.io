# About
You've heard of Markdown, perhaps even Markleft or Markright â€“ but have you heard of Markthrough? Probably not! Markthrough is a lightweight markup syntax that's just a step up from plaintext.

This project is still under development. For updates, see the project's [repository](https://github.com/markthrough/Markthrough.github.io).

### What makes Markthrough special?
Unlike Markdown, the plain text (ex. `**bold**`) and the final rendering (ex. **bold**) are two different things. If you wanted to copy/paste the final rendering of any Markdown text, you'd lose all the syntactic formatting (the `**` in `**bold**`).
